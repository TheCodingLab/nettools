# win-nettools
win-nettools is a project which contains by myself commonly used network stuff.
It is written in C++ for Windows and provides a Java API.

I'm not planing on doing it for other operating systems but who knows what comes in the
future. If you want to provide a translation in an other os feel free to make a pull
request.
